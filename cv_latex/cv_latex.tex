\section{Selected Projects}
\begin{yearlist}

\item{2018} {Diamond Analysis} {Scrapped diamond data from James Allen
  to analyse and identify the best diamond to purchase for the
  engagement ring.}
  
%% \item{2017} {Automated Data pipeline} {Employed Airflow to automate
%%   and streamline the process of converting raw data into analytical
%%   products.}
  
\item{2017} {Dive Log Validation and Classification} {Implemented the
  isolation forest to detect anomalies in dive logs such as dive
  computer failure, incorrect air mixture, and infeasible profile to
  \textbf{improve the soundness and safety of diving}.}

\item{2016} {The Reading Machine
  (\href{https://github.com/EST-Team-Adam/TheReadingMachine}{Github})}
  {Automated forecasting of commodity price utilising information
    scrapped from web pages. Sentiment extraction and topic modeling
    of news article coupled with Recurrent Neural Network to forecast
    the commodity price. The purpose of the project is to
    \textbf{identify potential food crisis and provide lead time for
      reaction}.}
  
%% \item{2016} {DataKind Datadive Hackathon} {Prototyped a web app in
%%   Shiny to provide information on the animal density and observation
%%   trend.}
  
%% \item{2014} {Ensemble Imputation
%%   (\href{https://github.com/mkao006/sws\_imputation}{Github})} {Lead
%%   research on flexible and robust imputation methodology. An ensemble
%%   learning model was formulated to impute the global production of all
%%   agricultural products. \textbf{Over 200,000 time series were tested
%%     and imputed}.}

%% \item{2014} {Information Quality
%%   (\href{https://github.com/mkao006/sws\_flag}{Github})} {Use of
%%   entropy to measure relative information content of various data
%%   sources in order to \textbf{measure the quality of information} and
%%   construction of distribution for modelling.}

%% \item{2013}
%%      {Sentimental Mining
%%        (\href{https://github.com/mkao006/sofi\_twitter\_activity}{Github})}
%%      {Scrapped Twitter data for sentimental analysis in order to
%%        understand the reader response to flagship publication}

  (\href{http://nzdmawards.co.nz/winners-archive/2011-winners-gallery/ministry-of-education-what-teacher-shortage}{RSVP
    Award})} {Forecasted demand and supply of teachers and analysed
  the labour force to provide insights on the reality of the teaching
  force. The RSVP and Nexus prize was awarded for \textbf{confirming
    that the teacher shortage was truly over and assisted in new
    policy formulation}.}

\end{yearlist}
  
\begin{yearlist}
    
\item{2011} {Project 'MOA'} {The project estimated the effects of
  various advertising channel in order to assess the respective
  efficiency and effectiveness. The estimations were then employed to
  optimise the allocation of the marketing budget for a large retail
  banking client. The result was a \textbf{79\% improvement in
    customer acquisition over the existing budget}.}


\item{2011}
     {Campaign 'AND'}
     {The project identified segments of individuals which are high
       achievers from students of economically deprived
       background. The uses of the PRIM algorithm \textbf{pinpoint a
         segment with a 70\% completion rate as opposed to the pool
         average of 41\%}. This resulted in improved utilisation of
       public funding.}
