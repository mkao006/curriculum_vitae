\section{Personal Summary}

My key strength is adapatability, being a seasoned data scientist, I have
experience from the ads, design, to the social media industry and also the
ability to thrive under different product and engineering culture.\\


The driving principle behind my working approach is simplicty over unnecessary
complexity, finding that clarity in approach not only expedites problem
resolution but also enhances the interpretability and explainability. \\

I love diving, in water and data!
